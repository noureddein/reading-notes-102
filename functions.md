# Chapter 11: Functions

## What is function?
### Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

## Terminology of function:
  - **Calling function**: When you  ask the function to perform its task its known as calling function. 
  - **Parameters**: The pieces of information pass to the function known as parameters.
  - **Return value**: When you write a function and you expect it to provide you with an answer, the response is known as a return value.

### Calling a function:
  * Having declare the function ,you can the execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code.

### Declaring functions that need information:
  * Some times a function needs a specific information to perform its task. In such cases, when you declare the functions you give it parameters, inside the function , the parameters act like variables.
