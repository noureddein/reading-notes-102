# Chapter 1 Structure of HTML
## This Chapter talk aboat the skelton of HTML.
 * HTML pages are text documents.
 * HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
 * Tags are often referred to as elements.
 * Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.

available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.
