# So, what is Git?
  * Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.
